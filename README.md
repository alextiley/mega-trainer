node-mvc-extended
=================

A boilerplate for developing MVC applications with node.js and express.js.

Out of the box this version of my boilerplate has some extra's that have been configured specifically for my own use, such as:

* Render override - allowing common data to be scoped to all templates;
* Authentication for admin section
* A partially working administration section

You may find some of this useful, so feel free to play around with my code. Please reference my github repo if you use any of the code here =)
